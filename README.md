Aim
To print even numbers from 0 to 10 using a for loop.

Tools Used
Programiz

Theory
A for loop iterates from a start value to an end value with a fixed step. By incrementing the loop variable by 2, only even numbers are printed.

Algorithm
1.Start the program.

2.Initialize i to 0.

3.Check if i is less than or equal to 10.

4.Print the value of i.

5.Increment i by 2.

6.Repeat steps 3 to 5 until condition fails.

7.End the program.

Conclusion
The program efficiently prints even numbers from 0 to 10, demonstrating the use of a for loop with a custom increment.
